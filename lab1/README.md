## Lab 1

**Exercise 1: Statistical Alchemy**  
Given the cereal stock of N supermarkets along a road, compute the **maximum median availability** across any sequence of at least K consecutive supermarkets.  

**Exercise 2: Spanning Trees with Two Criteria**  
Given a connected graph where each edge has profit and weight, find the spanning tree that **maximizes the ratio of total profit to total weight**, and output the result in reduced fraction form.
