# Algorithms-and-Complexity

This repository contains solutions to programming assignments from the university course **Algorithms and Complexity** of ECE NTUA.  
Each lab focuses on different algorithmic problems, requiring efficient design and implementation.

## Lab 1

**Exercise 1: Statistical Alchemy**  
Given the cereal stock of N supermarkets along a road, compute the **maximum median availability** across any sequence of at least K consecutive supermarkets.  

**Exercise 2: Spanning Trees with Two Criteria**  
Given a connected graph where each edge has profit and weight, find the spanning tree that **maximizes the ratio of total profit to total weight**, and output the result in reduced fraction form.

## Lab 2

**Exercise 1: Chocolate Trading**  
Given predicted chocolate prices over N days and at most K transactions, determine the **maximum profit** achievable by optimally choosing buy/sell days.  

**Exercise 2: Christmas Relay**  
In a tree-shaped road network, each city has a helper with different start-up and travel times. Compute the **minimum delivery time** for each city’s letters to reach the capital, following Santa’s rules.

## Lab 3

**Exercise 1: Commutes**  
In a country with N cities and M roads, each road closes for maintenance at a given time. With a budget of K upgrades (making roads permanently usable), determine the **latest possible time T\*** such that everyone can still reach their workplace. If unlimited time is possible, output `infinity`.  

**Exercise 2: Presidential Trip**  
During the president’s predefined journey, roads are temporarily blocked while his convoy is on them. Given the network of cities and roads, your starting city, destination, and departure time, compute the **minimum travel time** to reach your destination considering these dynamic restrictions.
