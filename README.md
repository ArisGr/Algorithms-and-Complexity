# Algorithms-and-Complexity

This repository contains solutions to programming assignments from the university course **Algorithms and Complexity** of ECE NTUA.  
Each lab focuses on different algorithmic problems, requiring efficient design and implementation.

## Lab 1

**Exercise 1: Statistical Alchemy**  
Given the cereal stock of N supermarkets along a road, compute the **maximum median availability** across any sequence of at least K consecutive supermarkets.  

**Exercise 2: Spanning Trees with Two Criteria**  
Given a connected graph where each edge has profit and weight, find the spanning tree that **maximizes the ratio of total profit to total weight**, and output the result in reduced fraction form.

## Lab 2

**Exercise : Chocolate Trading**  
Given predicted chocolate prices over N days and at most K transactions, determine the **maximum profit** achievable by optimally choosing buy/sell days.

## Lab 3

**Exercise : Commutes**  
In a country with N cities and M roads, each road closes for maintenance at a given time. With a budget of K upgrades (making roads permanently usable), determine the **latest possible time T\*** such that everyone can still reach their workplace. If unlimited time is possible, output `infinity`.
