## Lab 3

**Exercise : Commutes**  
In a country with N cities and M roads, each road closes for maintenance at a given time. With a budget of K upgrades (making roads permanently usable), determine the **latest possible time T\*** such that everyone can still reach their workplace. If unlimited time is possible, output `infinity`.
